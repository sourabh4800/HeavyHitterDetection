## Introduction

Uses a counting bloom filter to block flows for which the switch has observed more than
a certain number of packets (default 1000).


## How to run

Run the topology:

```bash
sudo p4run
```

or
```bash
sudo python network.py
```

Run the receiver and the sending scripts in `h2` and `h1` respectively:

```bash
mx h2
python receive.py
```

Send any number of packets from `h1` to `h2`. 

```bash
mx h1
python send.py 10.0.2.2 "number_of_packet"
```


## Output
Only the first 1000 will be received at the receiver's end
